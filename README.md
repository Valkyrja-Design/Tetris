The code for the Tetris game I made using the Godot engine. While the UI looks bland(very bland), I've tried to make up for it by implementing features like NEXT_PIECE, the 
daunting T-spin and storing highscores of the playthroughs.

If you simply want to try out the game, go to Tetris/ and download the two files then run the executable and enjoy!

Or if you want to improve/see the code, you can clone/download all the files and open the project in Godot engine.
I'll try to improve the game as I learn new stuff about the engine.
