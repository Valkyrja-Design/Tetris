The code for the Tetris game I made using the Godot engine. While the UI looks bland, I've implemented features like NEXT_PIECE, the 
daunting T-spin and storing highscores of the playthroughs.

If you simply want to try out the game, go to Tetris/ and download the two files then run the executable and enjoy!

Or if you want to improve/see the code, you can clone/download all the files and open the project in Godot engine.

The main code files are the files with .gd extension.
